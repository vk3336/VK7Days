# How to Fix Notification Issues

## Problem: "Enable alerts" shows "BLOCKED"

This happens when notification permission was previously denied.

## Solution:

### For Chrome/Edge:

1. **Click the 🔒 lock icon** in the address bar (left of URL)
2. **Find "Notifications"** in the dropdown
3. **Change from "Block" to "Allow"**
4. **Refresh the page**
5. **Click "Enable alerts"** again

### For Firefox:

1. **Click the shield icon** in address bar
2. **Click "Permissions"**
3. **Find "Notifications"** and set to "Allow"
4. **Refresh the page**

### For Safari:

1. **Go to Safari > Settings > Websites**
2. **Find "Notifications"**
3. **Find your site and set to "Allow"**
4. **Refresh the page**

## After Fixing:

1. ✅ Click "Enable alerts" - should show success message
2. ✅ Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now
3. ✅ Close the browser tab completely
4. ✅ Wait for notification + default ringtone
5. ✅ Click notification to test audio switching

## Mobile Instructions:

- **Android Chrome**: Settings > Site Settings > Notifications > Allow
- **iPhone Safari**: Settings > Safari > Notifications > Allow

The continuous refreshing issue should also be fixed now!
